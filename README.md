# Kauppalista

This is KauppaLista! My first React Native app. It's purpose is to work as a interactive shopping list, hence it's using sockets.
To get frontend running, firstly
```
npm i && npm i react-native-cli
```
if you have Apple device and Xcode installed, you can then in the terminal say
```
react-native run-ios

## Note 
that I developed this using ** only ** ios simulator. I have no clue what it is going to look like and how it is going to work with android version. 

To get backend running, cd into backend folder and then: 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

and after that by running 
python3.py
you should have the backend running
```

TODO: * Backend to heroku or equivalent so one could really use this while shopping :D
      * Building Frontend to IOS (preferably without App Store, too expensive for student) how?
